# Fall-Detection-Arduino-Python
This fall detection system prototype detects and simulates test cases using a wearable device that contains a tilt sensor and a button. The tilt sensor is used to detect falls and there are also leds to simulate the lightning system of a house.
The button placed on the wearable device can be used to alert care givers in case of an emergency. A web interface is used to send warning and sensor states to its users.
